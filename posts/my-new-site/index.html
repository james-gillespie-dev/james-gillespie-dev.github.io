  <h1>My new site</h1>
  <p>June 16, 2025</p>
<p>Welcome to my new site, this is my first post that I am making while I create this space. I have just figured out basic functionality for blog posts and photography posts.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a> to start my personal website journey because I love their ethos and idea of what the internet should be about. Self expression, simplicity and good vibes.</p>
<p>I then turned to the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> static site generator to manage content creation and smooth over writing the most tedious and repetitive HTML tasks. After figuring out how to translate my mediocre CSS knowledge into Hugo&rsquo;s theme system and learning about how great partials are I feel like I made some quick progress.</p>
<p>Taking a lot of hints and code from <a href="https://billglover.me/2023/11/07/creating-a-photography-gallery-with-hugo/">this</a> excellent blog post by Bill Glover, I set up the beginnings of a photography section of the site. I just need to start adding content so that I can see where the seams come apart.</p>
