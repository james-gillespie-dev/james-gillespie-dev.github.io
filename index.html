            <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website that I built myself with Hugo. I have made it to give myself a challenge in creating a website, and also to have a place to showcase my art, photography and anything else that I feel is worth journalling here. I am going for a retro, old internet feel with animated backgrounds and gifs and anything else fun that I find. Thankyou for visiting and have fun looking around.</p>
<p>Everything is still very much under construction as I am learning everything while also still deciding on the design and layout of what I actually want on the site.</p>
