    <p>I hadn&rsquo;t been to Jorgensen Park since we moved out of the Spring Road house and Athena was in Witchcliffe. But now that I am living in High Wycombe and Athena is with us, I have started taking her back there for walks.</p>
<p>I noticed that some of the smaller birds had begun showing their colourful mating plumage so I brought my camera up a few times and got a few ok shots while walking.</p>
<p>The red of the Scarlet Robin was especially striking when it landed on a nearby perch and the single blue Splendid Fairy Wren that I saw was beautiful as they always are.</p>
